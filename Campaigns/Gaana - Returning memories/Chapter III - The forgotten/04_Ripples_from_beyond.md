### "Ripples from beyond"
#### Prerequisites
  - Time Core is abused enough, so that time pockets are seeping
  into current reality. In this particular encounter three Royal
  Elven Guards are dragged just from the beginning of The Great
  Elven Onslaught.

#### Lore
  Liane, Mialoy and Feilir were guarding the main stairway to Oak of Wisdom.
  Day was clear yet strangely quiet. Mialoy felt tingling danger sensation
  when his eye caught shady figure disappearing behind a root of the great
  tree. The next thing he knew, he was standing next to Feilir and Liane
  surrounded by a young and silent pine forest. Quickly royal guards
  dispersed among the trees.
