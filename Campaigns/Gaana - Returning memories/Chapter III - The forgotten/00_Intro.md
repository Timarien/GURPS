# Campaign rules: 'Two headed mule'
  * Two campaigns run in parallel, with several meeting points through the
  storyline.
  * There should be at least one player swap, so that teams actually have
  different background knowledge.
  * To help reward calculation, give away 'parts' of CP. ("You have received
  2/100 worth of experience")

# Siege of the forgotten:
  In the year 471 of the Great Agreement, some of the Ancients machinery
  started malfunctioning. Past exiles from the void started appearing
  throughout the dessert. Hordes of time tortured orcs, trolls, humans
  and giants rampaged nearby cities and countries. Smaller habitats
  were abandoned, trade routes to Moarri were closed, people in Twinkle
  prepared themselves for incoming siege.

  Year 472 came by. Many men and orcs have died defending the border of
  Ironfire. Town of Twinkle still stands as the southern outpost, but the
  hope is thin. Never-ending hordes of soulless creatures are getting stronger
  in numbers. Bravest souls of Ironfire must step forward, find the root of
  this invasion and stop it at all costs.

# Starting set

## Party 1: The Blacksteels
  * Ranger
  * Knight
  * Any other (mixture or a Scribe)

## Party 2: Keepers of the gates
  * Member of Az'ir mage tower
  * NPC from the bloodline of Archmage Lev
  * One totally random fella

## Twinkle: *For the pick and hammer!*
  * Orcs and humans are living and working together. There has been a lot of
  changes since last century. Orks have won their rights among humans. Humans
  have proven themselves as fierce and _rgthul_ (nobly brutal) warriors among
  orcs.
  * Blacksteel order is no longer human only. Orcish warriors and mages are
  common sight.
  * Western gate has recently been attacked. Townsfolk are pillaging what is
  left of Sparkling Cliffs Hamlet. Crow murders are feasting on the dead bodies
  that are rotting in the soft autumn sun.
  (Quest 1) Blacksteel barricades on the Twinkle bridge and Valley road seem
  intact.

## Time Cores
  * Two time cores coexist on planet Raagna. One was the initial time core built
  and maintained by the Ancients, while another was 'dumped' in this planned
  during The Great Wars between the Ancients.
  * One of the cores start malfunctioning due to an excessive power drainage.
  * Malfunctioning core contains a whole lot of hatred inherited from time
  tortured Fire Mage Lev and wants to 'stop the voices' by releasing all of
  trapped creatures back to this timeline.
  * Trapped creatures are seeking revenge on those who banned them there
  during The Great Wars. Since most of them have lost their former conciousness
  they are basically rampaging mindless beasts, driven by pain and hatred.
  * Some of the creatures are saner than others and either help Conscribus
  by commanding The Forgotten forces, either plot their own escape, either
  follow their own goals.

## Forgotten generals
  * During campaign players may encounter high ranking officers from The Great
  Wars. Each of them have their own goals and motives, which may contradict
  existing plot line if required.
  * Generals usually have their strong and weak sides, i.e. some of them may
  have accepted the exile as rewarded punishment and may be fighting in order
  to stop The Forgotten from rampaging other realms. Other may be struggling
  to escape from the time prison and will be willing to do anything to be free.
