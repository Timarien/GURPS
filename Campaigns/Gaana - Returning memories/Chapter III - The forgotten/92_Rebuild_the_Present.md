### "Rebuild the Present"
#### Prerequisites
  - Elven Time Core must be destroyed completely

#### Tasks
  * Mainline
    1. Forgotten Conscribus is powerless, yet resists powering down
    2. Conscribus offers to defuse it from 'the other side'
    3. Kill the Incarnations of Conscribus
    4. Time Core powers down, Heroes remain trapped beyond time (and space)
    5.  -- think of a way to return --
  * Optional
    1. Fix the Elven Time Core by replanting the time seed in Forgotten Forrest
    2. Die and be incarnated by one of the Conscribuses

#### Rewards
  * End of campaign. Time cores are no longer functioning. Heroes become the initial planners for their return to Raagna. Which in turn should reintroduce similar starting conditions for replay.
