##"Gardens of Gaana"
  ... continued ...
  As Thunder Garret was treated to good health by local shaman, Tyla and Quark
  scouted around all accessible areas within the Village of Tranquility. All
  they could find, is that most of the people lived in 'The Park' and worked in
  the fields (large dome connected to the park dome, market dome and had one
  closed door leading to unknown location). 'The Market' was a six exit dome,
  with a large circular area in the middle. Buildings were 2-4 stories high,
  and most of center facing houses had huge windows on first floor. One of
  tunnels from 'The Market' led to dome full of ancient technology. None of
  the visible technology made any sense to anyone, neither inhabitants, neither
  Tyla or Quark. After a good night rest Tyla and Quark decided to visit Garret
  and were quite surprised to see him up and well (even after the injuries he
  had). They quickly noticed that Garret's eyes turned bright blue, identical
  to eyes of other inhabitants. But disregarding that, Garret felt great and
  was eager to get out of this underground prison. As the party approached
  the Mother for what they thought will be a long persuasion to let them out,
  mother nearly instantly replied:
    I am intrigued by the surface world, which, as Garret shown me, is no
    longer hostile, nor aware of our existance. I would gladly let you out,
    yet I may not, since there is no exit from this place. Only entry is
    guarded by the golems and they let noone out.
  Party members were granted a permission to look around wherever they want,
  since all are Gaana's children. Another search through the accessible areas
  yielded no results. Garret suddenly felt deep in his soul, that they should
  go back to the Mother as quickly as possible. He carefully spoke his mind to
  others. All agreed.

##"Help from the 'Controller'"
  As party retuned from fruitless search back to park dome, they noticed
  commotion near the entrance to the factory. As they entered the circle of
  people, they were greeted by the Mother, which quickly explained that one
  golem came out from the tunnels this morning and required audience with the
  three of them. As they approached, golem spoke:
    Commanded to lead you out. Work is pending.
  Without any ado, the golem started slowly limp across the dome. Party members
  bombarded the golem with bunch of questions, to which the golem tried to
  reply, yet not every answer was completely understood. At one point the
  golem even spoke in another, ancient, language, because it had no other
  way to explain what it had to say. Apparently this particular golem was
  unique since it could talk in current common tongue. That is one of the
  reasons it was in such terrible mechanical condition. No one could repair
  it and it refused to power down because 'Controller' forbid it. Order to lead
  the party out was also issued by the 'Controller'. Golem reached a panel near
  one of currently closed doors and stood still for a while. In a moment the
  door unlocked and slid away, revealing a half lit, plain and unremarkable
  tunnel. Half way through the tunnel golem stopped and showed a door leading
  to a circular shaft, surrounded by stairway leading up. Shaft was unlit.
    Up.
  Golem spoke abruptly and appeared tired, if that can be said about golems.
  Party did not want to leave just yet and wandered around newly opened areas
  of this underground city. Apparently it was HUGE. They walked for miles
  underground, reached a district which appeared to be filled with residential
  buildings, walked through an alley with huge statues leading to a circular
  dome, which had (different from others) a dark ceiling on one side. Stars
  were visible on the dark side of the dome. For some reason, one of them
  decided to urinate on the largest and most beautiful building in the dome.
  In a blink of an eye they were surrounded by completely silent golem guards,
  which only by their sheer presence drove the party away from the building
  and down the alley they came from. Soon after this party returned to the
  stairway. They climber for a while, until ended up on a mountaintop, in a
  round pavilion with all walls made from thin metal bars. The pavilion
  looked like a huge cage for small birds. On one side the 'cage' had a human
  sized door.

##"'Round the world"
  Checked most known locations for shards of Time Core

##"Who lives in a shack in a middle of nowhere?"
  Found a shack near the road. A lass shared her food and talked about possible
  artifacts nearby. Party was ordered to find her husband and son who are
  working in the forest nearby.

##"They sure do look tasty"
  Lone figure stood guard by an unremarkable pine tree. Guard lowered his
  spear and shouted towards the incoming party:
    Å’! Lises' mi!
  Party stood surprised as other two figures appeared from the forest and
  surrounded then.

  Liane, Mialoy and Feilir were talking to two humans and an orc. They felt
  really strange and for one thing for sure, they wanted some clarification
  on what is going on.

##"Terror bringer"
  Shady figure appeared in front of three elves and with a gesture forced
  the tall figures on the ground. After a moment of silence figure disappeared
  just as quickly as it appeared.
  Elves shot up to their feet and without any warning attacked the party.
