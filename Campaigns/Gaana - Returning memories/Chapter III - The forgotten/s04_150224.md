##"Embraced by the goddess"
  Healed up and infected with Gaana, traveled outside, to find new home for
  Gaana.

##"'Round the world"
  Checked most known locations for shards of Time Core

##"Who lives in a shack in a middle of nowhere?"
  Found a shack near the road. A lass shared her food and talked about possible
  artifacts nearby. Party was ordered to find her husband and son who are
  working in the forest nearby.

##"They sure do look tasty"
  Lone figure stood guard by an unremarkable pine tree. Guard lowered his
  spear and shouted towards the incoming party:
    Å’! Lises' mi!
  Party stood surprised as other two figures appeared from the forest and
  surrounded then.

  Liane, Mialoy and Feilir were talking to two humans and an orc. They felt
  really strange and for one thing for sure, they wanted some clarification
  on what is going on.

##"Terror bringer"
  Shady figure appeared in front of three elves and with a gesture forced
  the tall figures on the ground. After a moment of silence figure disappeared
  just as quickly as it appeared.
  Elves shot up to their feet and without any warning attacked the party.
