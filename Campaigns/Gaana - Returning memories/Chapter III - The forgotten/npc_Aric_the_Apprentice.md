##Aric, the Apprentice

> My name is Mikaere Massimiliano Lothar Salazar, but people call me Aric for
short. I serve my teacher and grandfather Cezar Victor Tadeusz Rog√©rio
Salazar. Together we are the last alive Gatekeepers, the last direct
descendants of Lev Salazar, the Fire and Time keeper, first and only god
which descended from mortal realm into the VOID and shaped the vast emptyness
to his own will. We protect and gather information about long forgotten
relics from previous civilization, which built the Gates.

###Appearance
