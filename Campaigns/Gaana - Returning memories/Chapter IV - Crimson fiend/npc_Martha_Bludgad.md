##Martha Bludgad

Mother of Vlad Bludgad, Diana and Henry Redwoods, grandmother of
Elzevier and Helena Redwoods.

Not much is known about her life before she came to Rivermeet with then a
two-year-old Vlad. She managed to find shelter in The Shambles. Here she
met her husband Vikar, who was a son of a wine maker from The Orchards.
Vikar had his luck in selling fathers wine and Martha was a great cook and
a fine mistress, so soon enough they found themselves running an inn.
Martha brought three children for Vikar: son Henry and two daughters Diana
and Estella. Martha's first son Vlad had acquired quite the name for his
stubbornness, strong hand and sharp mind. Henry was not as hotheaded as Vlad
and grew up to help father and mother in the inn. Daughters were also growing
up healthy and beautiful. As Martha's life appeared to be bright and stable
Estella died from plague and Diana shocked by her sisters death decided to
seek knowledge from northern witches in order to help others in need. Both
parents tried to change her mind, but at young age of 12 Diana Redwood left.
Soon after Vlad turned 14. He had no intention in helping with the inn or
learning a trade. Without any explanation on a stormy winter night young Vlad
Bludgad left Rivermeet, never to be seen again. Henry, on the other hand,
found a young lady from Rivermeet. They wed and took the inn for their home.
Martha and Vikar had few years of peace as Helena was born into Henry's family.
Unfortunately Henry's wife died giving birth to his son Elzevier. Henry decided
that his fate is not meant to be peaceful and went away to join arms brothers
of Fort Horth. Helena and newborn Elzevier were left in Martha's and Vikar's
care. Years passed as Helena grew into a young lady and Elzevier into a strong
man. Unfortunately it was soon clear that Elzevier is not the brightest child
of the lot. 'El' - as Helena called him - had trouble understanding anything
more complicated than a chicken. But he still was an enormous help in the inn,
so was Helena. Recently Vikar contracted scarlet and the illness took his lifei
in several months. Martha, now an old woman, no longer resembling the fiery
maiden she was in her youth, is still making the best stew in Shambles.
Assisted by her witty granddaughter Helena and dense grandson 'El' keeps
the four corners of the 'Shaken Egg'.
