##Martha Bludgad

Mother of Vlad Bludgad, Diana and Henry Redwoods, grandmother of Elzevier and Helena Redwoods.

Not much is known about her life before she came to Rivermeet with then a two-year-old Vlad. She managed to find shelter in The Shambles.

Here she met her husband Vikar Redwood, who was a son of a wine maker from The Orchards. Vikar made his living selling his fathers wine and Martha was a great cook and a fine mistress. And so soon enough they found themselves running quite a profitable inn.

Martha brought three children for Vikar: son Henry and two daughters Diana and Estella. Martha's first son Vlad had acquired quite the name for his stubbornness, strong hand and sharp mind. Henry was not as hotheaded as Vlad and grew up to help father and mother in the inn.

Daughters were growing up healthy and beautiful. Martha's life appeared to be bright and stable. However, the family suffer a tragedy of Estella dying from plague. Diana was devastated by her sister's fate.

Shocked by her sisters death she decided to seek knowledge from northern witches in order to help others in need. Both parents, scared by prospect of loosing second daughter, tried to change her mind, but to no avail. Diana Redwood was 12 years old when she sneaked from her parents room in dark autumns night.

Soon after Vlad turned 14. He had no intention in helping with the inn or learning a trade. Without any explanation on a stormy winter night young Vlad Bludgad left Rivermeet, never to be seen again.

Henry, on the other hand, found a young lass from Rivermeet. They wed and took the inn for their home. Martha and Vikar had few years of peace as Helena was born into Henry's family. Unfortunately Henry's wife died giving birth to his son Elzevier. Henry decided that his fate is not meant to be peaceful and went away to join arms brothers of Fort Horth.

Helena and newborn Elzevier were left in Martha's and Vikar's care. Years passed as Helena grew into a young lass and Elzevier into a strong lad. Unfortunately it was soon clear that Elzevier is not the brightest child of the lot. 'El' - as Helena called him - had trouble understanding anything
more complicated than a chicken. But he still was an enormous help in the inn, so was Helena.

Recently Vikar contracted scarlet and the illness took his life in several months. Martha, now an old woman, no longer resembling the fiery maiden she was in her youth, is still making the best stew in Shambles. Assisted by her witty granddaughter Helena and dense grandson 'El' keeps the four corners of the 'Shaken Egg'.
