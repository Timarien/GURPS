# The devil.

#### Chapter I

You came to Rivermeets late in the evening and enter through the gates near the
slums area called *Shambles* by locals. You ask the guards at gates where you
can find an inn. They direct you to the Shaken Egg Inn and provide you with
rough description how to get there. As your party is not familiar with the
area, you get lost on your way there.

The slums look nearly dead. You can hear a distant fragments of conversations,
or animal sounds. Once you think you hear an owl.  However, all of them seems
really far away. The last rays of suns vanishes under the horizon and you are
surrounded by darkness. You lit a torch and continue searching for the inn.

Suddenly you make a turn and end up in what looks like to be slums market
square. Buildings are further apart and its a bit lighter here. You remember
that guards told you about this place, and that the inn is not far away. As you
are crossing the market square you notice something happening behind one of the
stalls. As you approach you hear a scream which sends all of you running towards
the its source. As you approach you make quite a lot of noise and something big,
sleek and black jumps from behind the stall and leaps away soundlessly. You are
amused by the speed of the creature as it disappears in the alley.

You approach the stall and find a young lad. He looks heavily wounded. As you
try to speak with him you realis that he is in shock due to pain and terror
