On the fifth week of my journey the spirit stood before me. As It spoke the
words of power, my knees bended and I collapsed on the ground for this great
was Its power. It said that It was the End, It is the End and It will be the
End as the World Tree wills. And It called upon the visions and they showed me
the End and how it will come to be.

The Prophesy

- On the first month the veil will be teared
- On the second month you will unlearn what you learned
- On the third month the army of dread will come back
- On the fourth month the army of false hope will depart
- On the fifth month the day sky will bleed blood
- And last hope will die in the sand
- On the sixth month the piece long forgotten will be found
- On the seventh month the pieces long forgotten will be reunited
- And the fire purifying will be reignited.

The End
