On the fifth week of my journey the spirit stood before me. As It spoke the
words of power, my knees bended and I collapsed on the ground for that great
was Its power. It spoke that It was the End, It is the End and It will be the
End as the World Tree wills. And It bestoved upon me the End and how it will
come to be.

The Prophesy of End

> The veil will be teared and the End will come,
>   but a month of corruption will pass
> What has been learned will be forgotten,
>   but a month of darkness will pass
> Dread will raise and return for vengeance,
>   but a month of forgotten will pass
> Armies of false hope will depart,
>   but a month of treason will pass
> Day sky will bleed,
>   but a month of newcomers will pass
> Death will take it's toll in the sand,
>   but the month of bones will pass
> On the seventh month parts will be reunited,
>   and the End will cover its face with a veil.
