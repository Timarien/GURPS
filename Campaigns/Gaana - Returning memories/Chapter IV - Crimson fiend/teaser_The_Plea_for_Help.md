Ares dismounted at the stable of Fort Horth. She took her bag and rushed to
the administration quarters. Inner gate guards welcomed her. "At least this
time they are expecting me", she thought to herself. Previous visits to this
military fortification had not been without accidents, as Archipelago has
little to no power over the Blacksteel order, which runs things around here.
"Apparently you only need a gods punishment to be unleashed on the land, to
make these arrogant black cans of stolen steel at least somewhat mannered."
Ares smiled to herself as she rushed through the narrow staircases of the
keep. "Well lets see if they at least can provide me with some good news
regarding this mess".

    WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU SENT HIM ALONE???

    Majester Ares, we have no skilled men to spare. Southern provinces are under
    constant siege by...

    I KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE SOUTH!!! We sent the messenger four weeks
    ago JUST FOR THAT REASON!!! He carried all required papers to get all the
    help he would need. What were you thinking sending a lone unguarded
    apprentice to deliver the message? No wonder we had received nothing from
    him. As far as we now know - he is dead somewhere in the dark forests of
    K'Gar. That leaves me no choice. Get me a horse and ...

  A young soldier, apparently just a squire by his insignia, crashes through
  the office door. He is breathing heavily, from the amount of dust on his
  apparel you may guess he had a tiresome ride from afar. Without any official
  greetings he crams a letter into the hands of Grand Knight and stands aside
  to catch his breath. Sir Wilhelm opens the letter and stands motionless for
  a brief moment. His face turns completely red. He signals the squire to leave
  then turns to Ares as the door close.

    Twinkle has fallen.

  Silence fills the room as both understand the weight of these news.

    Majester Ares, we can't have you riding north for a vague hope of reaching
    some help from a lich that was presumed dead centuries ago. Tomorrow every
    man and woman from this fort will march south to meet the incoming army.
    And we both know that without your help the opposing side will grow too
    large for us to even try stopping...

  Ares stood for a brief moment.

    I will inform Archipelago about the turn of events. I understand that my
    help is crucial to hold this invasion, but you must understand the dire
    situation we are in is no longer manageable by our armies alone. Without
    the help from 'a long dead lich', as you said, we have little hope.

    We have a bunch of new recruits that came in over the past few weeks. We
    can dispose, I mean, send them to deliver your message. All remaining men
    will march south.

    I expect to see those 'fresh recruits' first thing in the morning.

  Ares turned around and angrily walked out.
