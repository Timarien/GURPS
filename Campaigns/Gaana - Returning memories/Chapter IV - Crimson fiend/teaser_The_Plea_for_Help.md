Sky was gray and light anoying rain was drenching land for the second day
when Ares finaly reached Forth Horth. She dismounted at the stables, grab her bag and rushed to
the administration quarters. Inner gate guards saluted her. "At least this
time they are expecting me", she thought to herself. Previous visits to this
military fortification had not been without insidents, as Archipelago has
little to no power over the Blacksteel order, the current occupants of the Fort Horth.
"Apparently a mare gods punishment unleashed on the land is enough to
make these arrogant black cans of stolen steel at least somewhat mannered."
Ares smiled to herself as she rushed through the narrow staircases of the
keep. "Well lets see if they at least can provide me with some good news
regarding this mess".

    WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU SENT HIM ALONE???

    Majester Ares, we had no men to spare. We are spread thin as southern provinces are under
    constant siege by...

    RUPERT, FOR FUCK SAKE, I KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE SOUTH!!!

  After this outburst she spends few seconds to collect herself as she continues
  with much calmer manner.

    We sent the messenger four weeks ago JUST FOR THAT REASON!!! He carried all
    required papers to get all the help he would need from you. What were you
    thinking sending a lone unguarded apprentice to deliver the message?
    No wonder we had received nothing from him. As far as we now know he is
    dead somewhere in the dark forests of K'Gar. That leaves me no choice. Get me a horse and ...

  A young soldier, apparently just a squire by his insignia, crashes through
  the office door. He is catching his breath and from the amount of dust on his
  apparel you may guess he had galloped from afar, probably changing his horse
  several times. Without any official greetings he crams a letter into the hands
  of Grand Knight and leans to the wall near the entrance. Sir Wilhelm opens the
  letter and stands motionless for a brief moment. His face turns completely white.
  He signals the squire to leave then turns to Ares as the door closes.

    Twinkle has fallen.

  Silence fills the room as both understand the weight of these news. The news strikes
  Ares unprepared and she almost stumbles. A moment later the commander of Blacksteels
  breaks the silence. In quite, resolute voice he states an unconfortable true.

    Majester Ares, we can't have you riding north for a vague hope of reaching
    some help from a lich that was presumed dead centuries ago. Tomorrow every
    man and woman from this fort will march south to meet the incoming army.
    And we both know that without your help we have no chance.

  Ares stood for a brief moment.

    I will inform Archipelago about the turn of events. I understand that my
    help is crucial to hold this invasion, but you must understand the dire
    situation we are in is no longer manageable by our armies alone. Without
    the help from 'a long dead lich', as you said, we have little hope.

    We have a bunch of new recruits that came in over the past few weeks. We
    can dispose, I mean, send them to deliver your message. All remaining men
    will march south.

    I expect to see those 'fresh recruits' first thing in the morning.

  Ares turns around and leaves a room in hurry. The loss of Twinkle is going to have severe
  consequances: both for battle plan and for morale of armies. Twinkle was one of key
  cities and military centers. As she reaches her horse, the drums of war signals everyone
  to get ready for a march.
