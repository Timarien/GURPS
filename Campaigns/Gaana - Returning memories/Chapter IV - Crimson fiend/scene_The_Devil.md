# The devil.

#### Chapter I

You arrived at outskirts Rivermeet late in the evening. The keep towers warmly
shimmered above the orchards. You were exhausted from a long trip and wanted to
find a decent place to sleep. You saw someone still walking between the
fruit-trees and asked the late bloke for directions to a nearest decent place
to stay for the night. He gave you a general direction to "Cross and Toad" and
walked away on his own business. Good thing the place he mentioned was hard to
miss. Well lit and in the main crossroad, "Cross and Toad" willingly invited
everyone to come in. Unfortunately you quickly were returned to reality by
fancy dressed host, which demanded 5 silver pieces only for a nights stay.
As you humbly asked if there is a place where you and your party could rest for
a more 'understandable' price, host looked down on you with contempt and
pointed south-west. He mentioned something about "shambles" and "chickens" and
requested that we leave at once, if we do not intend to eat or sleep at "Cross
and Toad". As you walked away into a maze of smaller buildings Un was setting
below the rooftops. You were met with an unmistakable stench of rotten meat.
You tried to calm yourself that this place is called Shambles because they sell
rotten chicken meat. Or maybe some other meat. And maybe not rotten. Dark
figures were moving in the shadows here and there. You lit your torches and
continued to search for a bed. Most of the buildings had their windows tightly
shut. You were not sure if the inhabitants were afraid of the dark, the stench,
or other inhabitants. You were not sure if there are any inhabitants, since it
was extremely quiet, even for this type of night. Finally you reached the river
bank. Un was beautifully setting in the distance, coloring the waters of
Swaymist river bright orange. This view helped you to calm down and turn around
to continue searching The Shambles for an inn. Soon enough you followed a path
which appeared to lead directly to the very center of this district. In a
little square, a lone building with lit windows stood. Your brief moment of
happiness was broken by a terrorizing scream from an alley just behind you.
Quickly turning around you catch a glimpse of a dark large creature quietly
leaping away from behind a stall and disappearing into thick darkness. As you
rush to the stall you find a heavily wounded young fella. His eyes are full of
terror and his lips are moving monotonically, yet making little sound.
