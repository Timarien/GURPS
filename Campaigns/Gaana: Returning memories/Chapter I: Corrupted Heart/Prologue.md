Prologue
========

After disappearance of Ancients southern lands of 'Archara stayed uninhabited for centuries before first settlers migrated in.
Soon enough deserted cities came back to life. Deserters, wanderers and nomads found their new homes in the ruins of mighty Ancients.

City of Gord was the cradle of civilization and prosperity, which spread to nearby cities. Soon enough thirst for power arose among the most
wealthy and influential families of Gord. First family to declare itself as the leading line was House de Tier. By blood and gold they gained
their power in the city. During their reign of nearly two centuries they established Kingdom of Gord, spread along the coast of Kiald, from
Dragtuth mountains to high peaks of Frestur, with most notable cities of Gord, 'Ardron and Hindar.

Priest order of Auvae collected the remaining knowledge of Ancients and controlled the main religion in Kingdom. While being the most influential
force among lower castes they shy away from publicity. They successfully keep magic and deeper knowledge outside the law, which in turn is still
dictated by them.

The last de Tier to climb the throne, Augrono De Tier, was a weak and shortsighted leader. He started conflicting with local priesthood, disobeyed
sacred laws and created tension between the Auvae and the throne. This situation was quickly exploited by another family, Del'rad. They started a
civil uprising, in turn killing every last of de Tier in the city of Gord. Last known living offspring of Augrono -- brothers Antonio and Frocho have
avoided death and disappeared.
