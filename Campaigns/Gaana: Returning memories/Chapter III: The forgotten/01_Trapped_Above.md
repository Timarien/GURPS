###"Trapped Above"
####Prerequisites
 Any of:
  - Hear that Blacksteel rangers have not returned from shift change at Overseer
  - Notice warning fire being lit at Overseer

####Tasks
  * Mainline
    1. Chop Your way through the forgotten to the entrance of the Overseer
    2. Climb up to the top, conversate with fresh recruits
    3. Watch a pack of the forgotten joining others in a camp south-east of
  Twinkle
  * Optional
    - Stumble upon cellar and a door to Ancients tunnels

####Rewards
  * Rescuing the Blacksteel rangers rewards with premature knowledge about
  forgotten camp south-east from Twinkle and a map which allows to sneak up to
  the camp. Also karma points :)
  * Fresh recruits are grateful for their lives, they promise to give the party
  a free treat when they will be back to barracks in Twinkle.

####Twists
  * An old man creeps out of the cellar, snatches an item from one of the slain
  forgotten and disappears back to the cellar

####Resolution
  * Blacksteel ranger was terrified and taken hostage. He is unwilling to give
  any details. Adventurers did not climb up the tower, since the ladder up was
  demolished.

  with a huge rock, only finding it misplaced to the treetops nearby.
  * Saw an old man dragging a corpse to the tower and mysteriously disappearing.

####Open ends
  * Both of the recruits have fled.
  * Old man has a corpse.
  * Old man somehow moved a huge rock to the treetops.
