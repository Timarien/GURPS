#Campaign rules: 'Two headed mule'
  * Two campaigns run in parallel, with several meeting points through the
    storyline.
  * There should be at least one player swap, so that teams actually have
    different background knowledge.
  * To help reward calculation, give away 'parts' of CP. ("You have received
   2/100 worth of experience")

#Siege of the forgotten:
  In the year 471 of the Great Agreement, some of the Ancients machinery
  started malfunctioning. Past exiles from the void started appearing
  throughout the dessert. Hordes of time tortured orcs, trolls, humans
  and giants rampaged nearby cities and countries. Smaller habitats
  were abandoned, trade routes to Moarri were closed, people in Twinkle
  prepared themselves for incoming siege.

  Year 472 came by. Many men and orcs have died defending the border of
  Ironfire. Town of Twinkle still stands as the southern outpost, but the
  hope is thin. Never-ending hordes of soulless creatures are getting stronger
  in numbers. Bravest souls of Ironfire must step forward, find the root of
  this invasion and stop it at all costs.

#Starting set

##Party 1: The Blacksteels
  * Ranger
  * Knight
  * Any other (mixture or a Scribe)

##Party 2: Keepers of the gates
  * Member of Az'ir mage tower
  * NPC from the bloodline of Archmage Lev
  * One totally random fella

##Twinkle: *For the pick and hammer!*
  * Orcs and humans are living and working together. There has been a lot of
  changes since last century. Orks have won their rights among humans. Humans
  have proven themselves as fierce and _rgthul_ (nobly brutal) warriors among
  orcs.
  * Blacksteel order is no longer human only. Orcish warriors and mages are
  common sight.
  * Western gate has recently been attacked. Townsfolk are pillaging what is
  left of Sparkling Cliffs Hamlet. Crow murders are feasting on the dead bodies
  that are rotting in the soft autumn sun.
  (Quest 1) Blacksteel barricades on the Twinkle bridge and Valley road seem
  intact.
