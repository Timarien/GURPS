It was a dark and stormy night, as I was obliged to write these lines, now we may continue the story like it really began.

Early Fall of the 5th year of the Demon

Black Throat Inn

It was a peaceful evening in a local pub. The pub was half full, with all sorts of strangers sitting alone in dark corners. Most of them
appeared to be no good low lives, while some looked like old war veterans, some of the towns folk were here too, mostly because they had
a tough day harvesting crops and wanted to rest for a while. When priesthood messenger opened the door everyone was minding their own
business. The messenger quickly rang his bell and announced that priests are offering a bounty for a transport mission. More details
should be given at the towns square in a moment. Most of the visitors followed the messenger, leaving the inn somewhat deserted.
The innkeeper took his moment to clean the tables, before they all returned, just as he thought they will. Innkeeper knew that no sane
man would risk his life traveling the country for some old fagot, when there are plenty of food and jobs here, in the safety of Gord.

"Those darn demons. Spreading like a curse for this land." -- an old man mumbled in the corner.  
"Maybe it is gods punishment?" -- replied the bartender.  
"Yeah. Punishing us for killing our brothers. I killed no man in the slaughter of de Tiers. Neither did my sons."  
"Some of us just did what we were ordered to do." -- an old veteran spoke -- "No one wanted this massacre."  
Grim silence fell in the pub. Bartender returned behind the counter as first men started returning from the towns square.  
"Pfff, they want a band of idiots to safeguard a living relic to Hindar." -- started one of the returnees.  
"Yeah, and they think they can persuade us to loose our lives for eight golden coins."  
"And a donkey." -- inserted one of them.  
"And a donkey." -- huge woodcutter nearly laughed as he sat at the counter.  
"You could use the donkey as a bait for the demons."  
"Or you could fuck the donkey, as it would be your last."  
-- Chatting went on, as the inn filled --  

Later on a group of adventurers entered, they seemed to be quite content about something. They sat at one table and ordered a round of drinks.
After several rounds, a staggering beauty entered the inn. Barkeeper knew her too well. Gaya Aarthu. Foreigner from the nearby kingdom of Bachaga.
Seeing her here made him nervous. He knew that this will end in a bar fight. It always ended like that. She was a magnet for trouble. Out of which
she always stepped out with grace. Leaving others in blood and pain. Soon enough she was surrounded by two locals, who gave her drinks and tried to
get through to her. Good for them that they were sober enough to keep their distance. Unfortunately a drunk shady figure tried to cast his nets on her.
Thankfully the fight was taken outside. Local woodcutters quickly returned with the lady, while the shady figure was dragged in by his mates.
Shady one was comforted on the chair among the adventurers.  
"Idiots. They will loose their lives for some old goat." -- Thought the innkeeper when he overheard them talking about their escort mission.
But they payed well for the night in the inn, so he had nothing to complain about. And left when the morning came.
