### 5th year of the Demon
#### 33th of First Summer

Lovely weather we are having, my garden is tended quite well and plans for rooting are set.
By the looks of it we will have a lot of red wine just before the Second Autumn.

#### 35th of First Summer

Ziggurat dwellers seem to be interested in the garden of mine. One of them appeared at my doorstep today,
acting all intrigued by our little plan all of a sudden. What surprised me the most -- he offered help,
in exchange for some knowledge about these demons that are plaguing our lands for the last several years.
As it seems beneficial, I agreed to provide any help that I can on this topic.

#### 36th of First Summer

Received a package of ashrock dust. It will fit nicely in our little scheme.

#### 37th of First Summer

Note to self: ashrock mixed with iron powder and sulfur produces an exploding substance that creates huge amounts of fume.
My workshop is still full of hardly breathable fumes from the accidental explosion in the morning.

#### 39th of First Summer

Found a way to produce the mixture safely. Using thick cloth bag, I add some sulfur grains to the bottom of it, then lay a thin layer
of beeswax, to cover all sulfur, I can carefully put the remaining powder on top. Reaction starts if You crack the wax layer by shaking or
hitting the bag to hard surface. Actually if the bag is held in a warm place -- the same should happen.

#### 1st of Second Summer

Had some issues with my garden. Our store for seeds have been overrun by some large rats. More than that, some rumours about magical artifact
that was brought in to the city by our beloved priests have reached my ears. I wonder since when are they interested in magic? Perhaps they
realized that without it we are easy prey for anyone that knows it? Perhaps fear of those demons forced them to reconsider?

What else -- I have been visited by Hu, he asked for shelter while he does his errands in this city. It has been a long time since we last met.
I wonder what does Master Thon'Gur know that he sends one of his favourite grandsons to us? I can't shake the feeling that I will find out soon
enough.

#### 2nd of Second Summer
