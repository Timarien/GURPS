Family of Gaana
===============

After genocide carried out by a powerful fire mage, full turquoise eyes became
a rare feature, only bestowed by a handfull of survivors. As years have passed
one survivor, little girl named Sierra, tried to bring together whomever that
remained alive and sane. They found their little sanctuary in one of ancient's
underground cities, where they could be safe from fear of common folk and wrath
of Lev, the fire mage.

Nearly after 30 years the little underground village was still a safe heaven for
the last remaining survivors: Sierra, Tam and Grktok. As years passed, Sierra,
or The Mother, gave birth to many children, all of which carried blessing of
Gaana.

Soon enough Sierra realised that her gift of Gaana could be transfered to other
people without actually giving birth to them. This led to experiments with
captives from raids or animals. Unfortunately only a handfull of 'participants'
survived the transfer, thus leading to belief that only chosen ones may carry
Gaana within them.

Then she found out about Mal'ruk. Who had a different story, about how he got
the gift...
