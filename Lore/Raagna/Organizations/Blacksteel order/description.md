Blacksteel order
================

Few things are known about this group, as only legends reach the ears of common
folk.

The order was instituted during the era before the Great Settlement to protect
and serve rulers of Ironfire. During that period Ironfire was under constant
attack from nearby orcs, raiding parties and foreign countries. Mostly because
Ironfire was protecting the secret of steel and harbored huge amounts of
treasures attained by trading steel weapons, armor and innovative contraptions
with distant lands.

Members of this order can be recognized by signature 'black' weaponry, forged
from highest quality steel. More often than not, they were seen wearing dark
full-plate armor, draped with capes that carried no insignias or symbols. All
members of the order are considered deadly fighters, well known tale states that
a hand-full of blacksteels held the town of Twinkle against a vast army of
raging orcs for more than five octans, then swiftly broke their formations and
assassinated their leader. While each of them is a talented weapon wielder,
their prowess in unarmed combat is more than considerable as well. Legends state
that a member of the order can outmatch an orc in an unarmed brawl with great
ease. These warriors, however, are an  uncommon sight. Their ways are shrouded
in shadow and legend.

But if any of the tales are true, then no mercy is to come to those, who meet
them in battle as enemies.
