Blacksteel order consists of three pillars:
Knights, Scholars, Rangers.

Each of these pillars are governed by respectively:
Grand Knight, Eldest Keeper, Master Observer.

The high command of Blacksteel order is held in the hands of these three 
individuals, they determine paths and actions of this order.

Blacksteel order formed around the secret of advanced steel metallurgy and later
collected and assimilated many other secrets of Raagna.

Order is bound by vow to serve Ironfire and its people, while maintaining its
right to deny any authority that might arise withing the city. This is one of
the reasons why democracy is well established in Ironfire.

There are no other limitations to what the order should do.

New recruits are selected by existing blacksteel members, who have infiltrated
various places. Including Ironfire army, Archipelago mage university and others.

Order tries to remain secret whenever it is possible or beneficial. Though
sometimes order does show their flag in public. More often than not such
exhibition results in history changing events.

Signature gear obtained from the order is recognised among more enlightened
people and it is considered to be an honor to carry this gear. Carrying such
gear does not impose that You are good or evil, order is known to act in its
own ways to achieve mysterious goals.
