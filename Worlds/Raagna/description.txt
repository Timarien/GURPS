Planet Raaga
 - The land of two suns
=========

Physics
---------

Third planet in this solar system, with an obital period of 512 days.
Slighlty bigger than earth, with stronger gravity. (G_Raagna = 1.1G_Earth)
Gravity change can be aclimatized to and completely ignored, unless dealing with
precise calculations.

Su (larger sun) is much larger than Un (lesser star) thus it appears that Un is 
orbiting Su, with a perceived period of 32 days. Actual period is slightly shorter.

Planet spins in the same direction as Earth (east is in the east =])

Known solar system, by order:

Su and Un       -- stars
Lumos           -- little dark servant of the stars.
Tanisi          -- shiny colorful planet, similar to Venus in mythology.
Raagna
Ring of Tilkon  -- ring of asteroids, frequently causing meteor showers in Raagna.
Bohas           -- blue planet, god of open waters.
Hohasat         -- red planet, equivalent to hell in mythology. Gates of Hohasat
                   are protected by three giants, which came from three visible
                   satelites of Hohasat.

Other effects:

Tides are related to suns alingnment relative to Raagna. This means that tides
on Raagna are harsh and powerfull.

Weather changes have monthly micro periods. Temperature is dependant on both suns.

Geography
---------

Currently only one continent is created, so many others may exist.

Created regions:
  Bargore tundra
  Valgart river valey
  Shardtooth sea
  Grasslands of Graze
  Bungarth Hills
  Hiassing swamps
  Nordic/Freezing wastes
  Death valey
  The Dark (Kagar) woods
  ... consult the map for others ...

This continent spans weather from freezing to rainforests, with high mountains
verticaly aligned near west coast. Shardtooth sea in intercontinental sea similar
to Mediteranian sea. It joins the ocean in the east over some astonishing natural
wonder, which is not yet created.
