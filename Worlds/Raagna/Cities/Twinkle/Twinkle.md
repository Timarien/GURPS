Description
--------------
Mountain town, which started as a tiny miner settlement and grew during uneasy
times. Now Twinkle has no resemblance to the cozy small village it used to be,
hidden behind large dark walls, divided to clear and orderly districts, dark
during the brightest sunlight and cutthroat dangerous during icy nights.
Twinkle is practically owned by Blacksteel's, which run most of metallurgy and 
gem cutting operations by day, while underground factions roam unhindered by night.
To an outsider it may seem that the town never sleeps, with 'The Twins' blazing
their smiths and orcs slaving away their last breaths, with the jewelers cutting
their precious gems and the mysterious inhabitants of 'The Assembly' watching
every convoy and trader passing through.

Notable locations
--------------
1.  The Vault
    Blacksteel keep, which is used as keep for all valuables, created within the
    city. It is told that wealth accumulated within is larger than anything one
    could ever imagine.

2.  Gem Clock
    Built as a gift from clock master Lorenzo to the town in which he was born.
    The clock is an exact duplicate to one that Lorenzo built in Archipelago.

3.  The Twins
    Smiths and forges are located here.
