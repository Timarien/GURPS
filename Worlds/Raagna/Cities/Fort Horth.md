Description

A town built around the outermost military outpost of state of Ironfire. Surrounded by a double perimeter
of defensive stone walls. The inner perimeter houses the military outpost, complete with soldiers barracks, 
main arsenal, Maiden of Hope hospital,
heavilly fortified keep with reinforced walls, mage district with monolithic obelisk, city governmental 
buildings, houses for the upper class and government officials, a few parks, a classy brothel, a liquor 
distillery and store, tea house and chocolaterie and a few high-profile restaurants. Outter perimeter 
contains the engineer district, namely Mallan's workshop, training grounds, sentry armoury and barracks,
merchant district with market, craftsmen district, most residential buildings are found here, several 
breweries, a "Skunk's breath" distillery, pharmacy, Rabbit's house of pleasure (A "classy" place. 
Definately. Mmmyah. Right next to the pharmacy (how fortunate...)), a few inn's welcome travellers and offer
them rest and a meal, few pubs and a really bottom-o-the-barrel-grind-your-face-into-the-floor tavern
known as "The Splinter" which offers attractions to the most boisterous of people. Outter perimeter wall has
three gates which guard the entrence and exit from the city. South gate is known as the "Rivers gate".
The road from this gate leads to a forking which splits into two roads, one of which leads to the town of
Twinkle and the other travels through Blood Fields. The East gate, known as the "Orc gate" opens a road that
leads to the orc controlled territories. The West gate, known as the "Capital gate", opens the way to 
Ironfire. The only gate in the inner perimeter wall is the Knights gate, which sepparates the inner and 
outter perimeter.
