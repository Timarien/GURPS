    De Tier dynasty
---------------

Lasted for more than two hundred years, brought peace and prosperity to the valleys and mountains of Gord. Unfortunately leadership of the last leader -- Augrono De Tier -- was weak and frowned upon by locals. Sure enough competitive families arose. One of those families were Del'rad, using their wealth and influence managed to raise a conflict between De Tier's and Auvae Priest Order. This resulted in bloody conflicts between De Tier's and Del'rad's concerning natural resources and wealth. Naturally such conflicts were frowned upon by Priesthood, but this time they just let that happen. Final conflict was more of a massacre. Del'rad's attacked De Tier household and sloughtered every one resisting soul. Luckily a handful of De Tier's were away at the moment and survived.
