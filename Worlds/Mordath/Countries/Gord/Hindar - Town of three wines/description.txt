Notes

--------------

Third biggest city in Gord county.

Built on old ruins from previous civilization it contains the ziggurat temple in the middle.

The city is based on small river bank, so the main food sources are fish, poultry and fruits grown in orchards. Animal herds are brought back to the city during fall, then meat is served in every house.
This city is famous by its apple wine and its alchemist Bilkrut.

City celebrates Autumn crop collection with a week long festival, which starts with apple collection, then the whole wine preparation takes place, and only on 6th day fresh wine is tasted.
During the festival, before the sixth day -- no alcohol is served or sold. There are few competitions during the festival, all of which are somehow connected to wine making.
