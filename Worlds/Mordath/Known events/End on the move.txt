End on the move
==============

This adventure took place in early fall of 15th year of the Demon (formely known as Del'rad,
named after ruling family of Gord).

  -- It all started by a simple fight in a pub. As many fights, this started for a woman. Not
  just any woman, but Gaya of Aarthu. -- unknown.

An escort was required to transfer a shard of "Disk of End" from Capital to more remote location.
Five adventurers accompanied by Ka'h escorted High Priest Graalh with his relict to Hindar.

After the journey five adventurers rested in Hindar and participated in annual wine festival.
Unfortunately their stay was interrupted by unnamed city officer, who forcedly asked them to
kill some demon rats in the Granary basement. He insisted that any demon nuisance is brought
to the city by the adventurers, who unwillingly or unknowingly transported demon attracting
artifact.

In an unpredictable turn of events, some of the adventurers attacked accompanying guards.
One was killed in an instant, while other managed to run away.
